# IMPORTANT: PROJECT IS OBSOLETE

Audeze finally decided after a few years to patch this "feature"<br>
This program is now useless<br>
Keeping the repo up just so I can see the commit history for key logger stuff

## What's this for?

This is a fix for the Audeze Maxwell's inital audio cutoff<br>
Currently, the common fix for this problem is to play a silent .mp3 file<br>
That does fix the problem, but it makes it to where the headset never shuts off<br>
This program however makes it to where the audio cutoff is gone and allows the headset to shut off after being inactive for some time

## How to install
1. Go to releases and download the most recent patch
2. Press Win+R and type "shell:startup"
3. Place exectuable in that directory. This allows the program to start on startup
4. Double click executable if you are wanting to run it now
